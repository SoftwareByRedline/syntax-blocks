# Syntax Blocks

The code editor fighting language syntax barriers. Currently in alpha stage.

## The code editor programming beginners were waiting for
OK, not yet in this alpha stage, but it will eventually make all programming learners' lives easier.

Users of this app will get a menubar at the top of the editor with many categories for different programming languages. They can select and insert "blocks" of code they don't know how to write manually and eventually they'll remember these blocks.
