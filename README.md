# Syntax Blocks

The code editor fighting language syntax barriers. Currently in alpha stage.

## The code editor programming beginners were waiting for
OK, not yet in this alpha stage, but it will eventually make all programming learners' lives easier.

Users of this app will get a menubar at the top of the editor with many categories for different programming languages. They can select and insert "blocks" of code they don't know how to write manually and eventually they'll remember these blocks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Requirements
- `python3`
- `python3-tk`

## Install
Currently, in alpha stage, you can only install the program by copying it from the repo. You can either click on *Clone > Download zip* on the GitHub webpage or clone the repo by copying

`git clone https://github.com/SoftwareByRedline/syntax-blocks`

into the command line (you need `git` for that).

## Run
You can run the program by issuing the command

`python sblocks.py` (or if that doesn't work, `python3 sblocks.py`)

from the directory of the cloned repo.
